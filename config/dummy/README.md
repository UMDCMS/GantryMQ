# Dummy configurations

Configuration files for settings up various hardware instances as "dummy"
interfaces. This means that that all control function will "function" (execute
without error) but will not actually control any hardware, and the responses
will either do nothing, perfectly match the user input, or be assigned a random
number generator.
